# CUDAMatrixRotate
This is a simple CUDA program to rotate a Matrix by 90 degrees. Each matrix cell is assigned to a thread on the GPU, which does the calculations accordingly. The output is then checked with the output generated by the CPU matrix rotate. This is **not** an efficient way of solving this problem on the GPU, but the simplest to understand.
